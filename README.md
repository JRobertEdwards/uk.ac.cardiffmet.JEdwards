This is part of some work for a project I am working on regarding DNA sequencing.

The aim of this piece of code is to read in a txt file containing a dna sequence (TCAG characters) and output an excel file with an amount of characters and columns according to user input and also to display the next character in the sequence in a seperate cell. e.g. a user enters 4 and 3 as parameters and the output in an excel format will be: TCAG, CCGT, ACTG, A (A being the next character in the squence on the line below).

The format will also display 'Result n' depending on the paramters the user sets where n is number of columns entered.
